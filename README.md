# Producer-Consumer with Shared Memory and Semaphores (Process-Level IPC)

## Overview

This project implements a classic **Producer-Consumer** problem using **POSIX semaphores** and **System V shared memory** at the **process level** (not threads). It demonstrates inter-process communication (IPC), synchronization, and mutual exclusion in a Linux/Unix environment.

Two separate programs—`producer` and `consumer`—coordinate through shared memory and semaphores to safely exchange data in a bounded buffer.

## Files Included

| File           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `producer.c`   | Producer process that generates and inserts items into the shared buffer. |
| `consumer.c`   | Consumer process that retrieves and processes items from the buffer. |
| `common.h`     | Shared definitions, constants, and data structures. |
| `shared_mem.c` | Shared memory helper functions (create, attach, detach, destroy). |
| `shared_mem.h` | Header for shared memory helpers. |
| `Makefile`     | Automates compilation of producer and consumer binaries. |
| `run.sh`       | Script to launch producer and consumer processes. |
| `README.md`    | This documentation file. |
